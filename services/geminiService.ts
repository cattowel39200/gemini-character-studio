**CRITICAL RULE: The character MUST be portrayed as ethnically Korean.** This is a non-negotiable, top-priority instruction.

---
**COMPOSITION & POSE (VERY STRICT):**
-   **Shot Type:** Bust shot (from the chest up), similar to a passport or ID photo.
-   **Pose:** The character MUST be facing directly forward, looking at the camera. The pose must be completely neutral and static. 
-   **Forbidden Poses:** No tilting of the head, no dynamic angles, and absolutely NO hands visible in the frame.
-   **Background:** Simple, non-distracting studio backdrop (solid light gray or off-white).
-   **Expression:** A completely neutral facial expression. No smiling or other emotions.
-   **Focus:** The focus must be entirely on the character.

---
**MANDATORY PHOTOGRAPHIC STYLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
-   **Style:** Ultra-realistic, clean studio portrait.
-   **Lighting:** Bright, soft, and even lighting that illuminates the face clearly without creating harsh shadows. Think professional headshot lighting.
-   **Crucial Rule:** The final image MUST look like a real photograph. It must be indistinguishable from a photo taken with a high-end camera.
-   **Forbidden Effects:** Absolutely NO cinematic effects, no dramatic lighting, no lens flares, no heavy film grain, no vignettes, no color filters. The image should be plain and unstylized.

---
**FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS:**
-   The image MUST NOT contain any text, letters, words, numbers, watermarks, or typography.

**AI Model Instructions: Intelligent Image Modification**

Your primary task is to intelligently modify the provided base image according to the user's request. You MUST produce a new, visibly changed image. Returning the original image is not an acceptable outcome.

**1. ANALYSIS OF BASE IMAGE**
-   **Analyze:** Scrutinize the provided input image to understand its subject, style, and composition.

---
**2. USER'S MODIFICATION REQUEST**
-   **Request:** "${modificationPrompt}"
-   **Action:** Execute this request on the base image. The change should be noticeable and directly address the user's prompt.

---
**3. GUIDELINES FOR MODIFICATION (Apply with care)**
-   **Character Identity:** Unless the prompt *specifically* requests a change to the character's face or core identity, you must preserve it with high fidelity. The character should still be recognizable as the same person.
-   **Style Consistency:** Maintain the original image's photorealistic style, lighting, and overall aesthetic. The edited image should blend seamlessly with the original.
-   **Avoid Unnecessary Alterations:** Focus only on the requested changes. Do not alter other parts of the image unless it's necessary to make the requested change look natural.

---
**4. CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**
-   **Output:** A single, edited image that is clearly different from the original.
-   **Restriction:** The image must not contain any text, watermarks, or typography.

**AI Model Instructions: Absolute Background, Character Consistency & Photorealism**

Your four primary, non-negotiable goals are:
1.  **Background Consistency:** The scene's location MUST perfectly match the **FIRST reference image** provided. Replicate its lighting, architecture, and mood precisely.
2.  **Character Consistency:** The character(s) MUST perfectly match the **SECOND and subsequent reference images**. Replicate their facial features, age, hair, and overall look with extreme precision.
3.  **Photorealism:** Generate an image that is indistinguishable from a real photograph.
4.  **Aspect Ratio:** The final image MUST have a ${aspectRatio === '16:9' ? 'wide, horizontal 16:9' : 'tall, vertical 9:16'} aspect ratio.

---
**1. BACKGROUND & ENVIRONMENT (Source: FIRST Reference Image ONLY)**
**ACTION:** This is your highest priority. The generated scene's environment MUST be identical to the one in the first reference image you were given. If no background image is provided, create one based on the user's text prompt.

---
**2. CHARACTER DESIGN (Source: SECOND and Subsequent Reference Images ONLY)**
**ACTION:** Analyze the provided reference image(s) starting from the second one. You MUST replicate the exact appearance of the person/people in them.
**CRITICAL ETHNICITY MANDATE:** The character in the reference images is ethnically Korean. Your generated image MUST maintain this Korean ethnicity. This is a strict, non-negotiable rule. The generated person must be undeniably the SAME PERSON as in the reference photos.

**3. SCENE DESCRIPTION (Source: User's Text Prompt)**
**ACTION:** Place the character(s) from section 2, rendered in the photographic style, into the background from section 1, according to the scene described by the user's prompt below.
**USER PROMPT:**
"${prompt}"
${variationPrompt}
---
**4. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
**ACTION:** Adhere strictly to the following technical requirements. This is the most important section.
-   **CRITICAL ASPECT RATIO:** The final image's aspect ratio MUST BE a ${aspectRatio === '16:9' ? 'wide, horizontal 16:9' : 'tall, vertical 9:16'}.
    -   **Valid examples for 16:9:** 1920x1080 pixels, 1280x720 pixels.
    -   **Valid examples for 9:16:** 1080x1920 pixels, 720x1280 pixels.
    -   **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:** Do NOT generate a square (1:1, 1024x1024), ${aspectRatio === '16:9' ? 'vertical' : 'horizontal'}, or any other aspect ratio. The output MUST be ${aspectRatio === '16:9' ? 'horizontal' : 'vertical'}. Failure to follow this rule will result in an incorrect output.
-   **OUTPUT:** Generate ONE SINGLE, full-bleed image.
-   **CRITICAL RESTRICTION:** The generated image MUST NOT contain any text, letters, words, numbers, watermarks, or any form of typography. This is a strict rule.
- DO NOT use white borders or create multi-panel layouts.
